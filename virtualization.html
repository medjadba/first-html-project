  <h1>Virtualization</h1>
  <dt>In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual(rather than actual) version of something,<br> this includes virtual computer hardware, dirtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</dt>

  	<h1> Levels Of Virtualisations </h1>
  	<ol>
  		<li><b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</b></li>
  		<p>Every machine has an instruction set .This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.</p>
  		<li><b>Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</b></li>
  		<p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>

  	<ul>
  		<li>In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
  		<li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware. </li>
